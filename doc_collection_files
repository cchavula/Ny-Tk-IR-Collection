The documents used to build the collection in the study were obtained from the web. No other source was used. If you are interested to use the documents please visit the urls below to access the information. Some of the documents used are in the public domain. The majority of the documents used in the collection were pdf documents which were created for distribution and written using formal language. Additionally, some of the documents were very big and treating them as a single document would have resulted in having a few documents being relevant to the query. Because of this, a single page of the documents was treated as a document. In the pre-processing step for the documents, each document was broken down into individual pages and converted to text files and cleaned to remove bad characters. However, judgements were done on pdf documents to provide context for the text.
